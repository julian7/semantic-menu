SemanticMenus
=============

It's a semantic menu generator which works well with Lockdown, and has both hierarchical and breadcrumbs support.

Inspired by and based on Daniel Haran's semantic-menu.

Example
=======

def AdminMenu
  build_menu do |root|
    add "User functions" do |user|
      add "New user..." new_user_path
      add "Manage users" users_path
      add "Manage group access" groups_path
    end
    add "Messages" do |msg|
      add "New message" new_message_path
      add "INBOX" messages_path
    end
  end
end
